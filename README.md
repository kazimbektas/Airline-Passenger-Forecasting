## Project Overview

In the airline industry, comprehending how demand changes over time due to seasonal trends, economic factors, holidays, and other influences is crucial. This understanding is essential for airlines to effectively plan resources, devise pricing strategies, and improve operational efficiency.

## Business Problem

For airline companies to effectively carry out operational and financial planning, it is essential to accurately estimate future passenger demand. Forecasting airline passenger demand based on historical data can help companies optimize resource allocation, maximize revenue, and reduce costs. 

This study aims to apply time series analysis techniques to predict future passenger volumes, utilizing a dataset that records monthly total airline passenger counts starting from 1949.

## Dataset

The dataset captures the monthly total airline passenger counts starting from 1949.
